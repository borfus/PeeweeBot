# PeeweeBot
Requires DSharpPlus (https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus)
You can create your own bot here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me

Pee-wee Bot is a Discord bot that stores a random word of the day (from a text file) and replies with a scream whenever anyone says anything if they say that word. Just like in the old show!

Currently the daily update does not work. Will post install instructions soon!
